# Student Portfolio (Starter)

Files added:
- `index.html` — main portfolio page
- `styles.css` — basic styling and responsive rules
- `main.js` — small interactivity (menu, form, skill bars)

How to use:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Edit headings, about text, and project cards to add your content.
3. For images, replace the SVG in the hero or add images into an `assets/` folder and link to them.

Next steps I can do for you:
- Add sample project pages and GitHub links
- Improve accessibility and semantic markup
- Add deploy instructions (GitHub Pages)

Tell me which of the above you'd like next, or provide color / font preferences.
